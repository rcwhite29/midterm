        <p class="copy">Officials began inspecting the damage of Notre Dame Tuesday. They declared
            the cathedral structurally sound while identifying “some vulnerabilities,”
            according to French Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez. Specifically,
            the vault and gable of the north transept were of concern. Inspectors are
            also worried about structural damage that may be hidden.</p>

        <p class="copy">Kirk Martini, a professor at the University of Virginia School of
            Architecture with a doctorate from the University of California at
            Berkeley in structural engineering, said the transept is probably the
            greatest vulnerability. To ensure the structure is stable, additional
            shoring may be necessary after the full extent of the damage is assessed.</p>

        <p class="copy">Limestone is a key building element of the structure, and stone is
            susceptible to damage from heat and water. “There may have been some
            damage to the stone, even the places that currently appear to be intact .
            . . because of the weaknesses of the material,” Martini said. “That’s a
            big unknown. . . . I don’t think anybody knows the extent of that damage.”</p>

        <p class="copy">French President Emmanuel Macron hopes the country can rebuild Notre Dame
            within five years. With the scale of the project, Martini is skeptical
            that timeline will be met, even with the number of resources being
            promised for restoration. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/04/16/yesterday-notre-dame" target="_blank" class="link">Hundreds of millions of dollars</a> have already
            been pledged for the rebuilding efforts.</p>

        <p class="copy">How the cathedral will be restored is also up for debate. On Wednesday,
            Prime Minister Édouard Philippe <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/notre-dame-fire" target="_blank" class="link">announced</a> an international competition to
            replace the iconic spire that collapsed into Monday’s blaze.</p>

            <img src="img/diagram.jpg" alt="Fire damage" class="photo fire">

        <p class="copy">Notre Dame is of geographic and cultural importance to Paris. It sits
            purposefully near the center of the city on a small island surrounded by
            the Seine River. It is also the landmark next to which all other Parisian
            monuments are measured.</p>

        <p class="copy">Martin Moeller, senior curator for the National Building Museum in
            Washington, said it is not coincidental that Notre Dame is one of the most
            famous Gothic churches. “The plaza in front of the cathedral was built
            specifically to give a good viewing point,” he said. “It's not an accident
            that so many people have taken photographs of the front of the church.”</p>

            <img src="img/graphic.jpg" alt="Tall boy" class="photo graphic">

        <p class="copy">There is already a debate brewing about how the church should be restored.
            Whether the efforts will include building materials similar to destroyed
            in the fire or more modern materials will be up for more discussion once
            officials fully assess the damage, to the building and to its artifacts.</p>

        <p class="copy">Much of the art and relics were saved from the flames. The cathedral’s
            large stained-glass windows appear to be undamaged, and there’s a strong
            case for restoring the famed structure as closely as possible to its
            former glory.</p>

        <p class="copy">Even the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press" target="_blank" class="link">White House</a>               offered assistance in the rehabilitation of the
            cathedral. While Notre Dame is revered around the world, Moeller stressed
            the importance of considering how other catastrophic fires of major
            landmarks are handled.</p>

        <p class="copy">In St. Landry Parish, La., <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/17/after-notre" target="_blank" class="link">three black churches</a> burned down from arson
            within 10 days in late March and early April. Before Monday, a GoFundMe
            for the churches had raised just below $50,000 in rebuilding aid. After a
            Twitter campaign urged people to remember the Louisiana churches amidst
            the devastation of Notre Dame, the total skyrocketed to $1 million by
            Wednesday.</p>

        <p class="copy">“Obviously it's one of most famous buildings in the world,” Moeller said
            of Notre Dame. “But we want to make sure that people remember that there
            are other buildings that are important to other communities. It may not be
            as famous, but when tragedy strikes there it can be devastating to a
            particular community or a particular group of people, and sometimes it
            doesn't get the attention it deserves.”</p>
